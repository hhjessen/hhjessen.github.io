<div class="w3-light-grey w3-round">
  <div class="w3-container w3-round w3-green w3-center" style="width:90%">90%</div>
</div>  
Routine user of the R software, it being my primary tool for data analysis and visualization. I am familiar with the syntax, function building, and able to quickly familiarize myself with new packages as needed.  
I am also a big proponent of RStudio, and have begun regularly using R-markdown for most of my writing and development tasks, such as this website.
&nbsp;

####LaTeX  
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">
<div class="w3-light-grey w3-round">
  <div class="w3-container w3-round w3-blue w3-center" style="width:70%">70%</div>
</div>  
Capable of creating visually pleasing reports, as well as other documents, using LaTeX. The PDF version of my CV, downloadable from the top of this page, is made using a mixture of Markdown and LaTeX within R-markdown.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

####HTML/CSS  
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

  <div class="w3-container w3-round w3-yellow w3-center" style="width:40%">40%</div>
</div>  
I am familiar with the basic syntax, and have created this website using mainly HTML and CSS, supplemented by Markdown within R-markdown. I am still taking courses to improve my skills in web design, hoping to be able to build more aesthetically pleasing websites.
&nbsp;

</div>  
Knowledgeable on how the software functions, and enthusiastic about the applications that the model has for management of fisheries. I have previously helped created a conceptual model of Lake Tanganyika using EwE, and I am confident that I would quickly be able to efficiently utilize the software. 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

####Python  
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">
<div class="w3-light-grey w3-round">
  <div class="w3-container w3-round w3-orange w3-center" style="width:30%">30%</div>
</div>  
Currently learning about the possibilities of Python, especially within data treatment and visualization, but I am currently more confident in R when performing these tasks. I am also interested in building simple web apps to simplify my workflow, and will be looking into this as my Python skills improve.  
&nbsp;

####MS Office  
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

<div class="w3-light-grey w3-round">
  <div class="w3-container w3-round w3-green w3-center" style="width:100%">100%</div>
</div>  
Very practiced in Word, Excel and Powerpoint, having routinely used all programs throughout my university years to a large extent. Despite being largely fluent in all the programs, I now aim towards independence from the software, and prefer to do as much of my work within RStudio as possible.

###Hobbies {.tabset}
####Tabletop games
<img src="img/chess.png" width="400px" style="float: right; margin-left: 30px">

I am fond of playing board games, and I own an extensive collection. I play both classic games, such as Chess and Go, as well as more modern games. I regularly get together with friends to play, and find it to be an excellent way to spend time together. I also regularly play tabletop roleplaying games, such as Dungeons and Dragons.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

####Strength training
<img src="img/lifting.jpg" width="400px" style="float: right; margin-left: 30px">

I care about my physical well being, and lifting weights is my sport of choice. I visit my local gym several times per week, aiming to improve my health and looks. For me, it is also a social thing, as I have friends who attend the gym with me, which helps motivate me when I have an off day.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

####Photography
<img src="img/chimpanzee.jpg" width="400px" style="float: right; margin-left: 30px">

I enjoy capturing landscapes and wildlife while in the field. I would thrive in a job that includes frequent travel, as I would love the opportunity to visit more exotic places around the world, of course with my camera in tow. If you would liketo see some of my photos, feel free to visit my 500px site <a href="https://500px.com/sjujimako">here</a>.

&nbsp;

####Sailing
<img src="img/sailing.jpg" width="350px" style="float: right; margin-left: 30px">

Denmark is an excellent country for sailors. I was raised in a family of sailors, which has made it's mark. I try to get as much sailing done as possible in the summer months. I competed in local sailing competitions throughout my high school days, but have not had the same access to sailing equipment after moving for my education. 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

####Skiing
<img src="img/skiing.jpg" width="400px" style="float: right; margin-left: 30px">

Skiing is my favorite outdoor activity, however, living in Denmark does not afford one many opportunities to practice. I try to get in at least one skiing trip per year when possible, and have been doing so since the age of 6.
