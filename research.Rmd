**Aquatic Ecosystems**  
I am especially fascinated by ecosystems. How several species can interact in so many different ways, to create a stable system, within ever-changing conditions or constraints affected by anything from seasons, to climate, to anthropogenic influences.  
In particular, I believe that trophic ecology is the foundation of ecosystem function; within the confines set by the physical/chemical characteristics of the system, 'who eats who' governs the majority of interactions, and as such, majorly impacts ecosystem funtion and services. I believe that understanding each species role in the food is the first step to understanding the species' role in the ecosystem; a crucial step in proper management.

**Ecosystem modelling**  
In order to ensure optimal management, it is not enough to know how any given ecosystem functions now, its is necessary to predict both: 1) How the ecosystem is going to respond to a given management action, and 2) How the ecosystem is going to respond to larger scales changes, such as climate variations.  
Models are our best predicive tool. Becoming increasingly more sophisticated, models that allow for accounting anything from trophic interaction and mass dynamics to changing climate conditions and anthropogenic stressors, such as overfishing, will prove vital in the years to come, and I want to be a part of their development.

**Fisheries biology and management**  
While I appreciate knowledge for the sake of knowledge. most research is, and should be, geared towards practical applications. One such application is the management of natural resources such as fish stocks.  
I want to help support sustainable utilization of these resources, but with the understanding that any such management will impact people whose livelihood depends on them.  
During my master's thesis fieldwork in western Tanzania, I worked closely with the local fishermen, which has given me great understanding of how citizens are affected by management/legislature. I want to help contribute to a solution that allows for sustainable use, whilst still considering the needs of the stakeholders.
