Because of this, I have to decided to pursue a career within research of these systems, and the species that live within them. To find out more about my motivations and research interests, please visit the 'Research Interests' tab.   \n</p>\n<p>\nAside from my biological interests, I have a mind for math and physics, and I am tech savvy. I believe in the predictive capabilities of models, and because of this, I spend a significant portion of my free time getting familiar with various coding languages. I am a routine user of R, capable in LaTeX, and I am familiar with the basic syntax of Python, MATLAB, and HTML/CSS.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis site contains information on not only my interests, but also my previous projects, research experience, and the skills I have acquired from them. As such, the site is thought to act as a expanded resumé. If you have any questions regarding what is written on here, please feel free to get in touch with me to discuss it further.
