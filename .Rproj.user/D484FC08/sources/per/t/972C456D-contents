My name is Henrik Høiberg Jessen, and I am a danish biologist, specialised in the aquatic ecosystems and their management.  
I am passionate about our ecosystems, and want to help provide the necessary knowledge needed to make informed management decisions. Because of this, I have to decided to pursue a career within research of these systems, and the species that live within them. To find out more about my motivations and research interests, please visit the 'Research Interests' tab.

<p>
Aside from my biological interests, I have a mind for math and physics, and I am tech savvy. I believe in the predictive capabilities of models, and because of this, I spend a significant portion of my free time getting familiar with various coding languages. I am a routine user of R, capable in LaTeX, and I am familiar with the basic syntax of Python, MATLAB, and HTML/CSS.
